# MediaPlayerExperiments

This is based on my part in an old work project that ended up unused by the client (published with permission).

After removing the business logic and connections to other parts of the project, not much is left except a PictureBox where you can drag the image around, zoom (mouse-centered), and adjust the borders in a way that shifts the image, which I thought was kinda neat and might be useful in some future side-project. Maybe someone else will find it useful, though I doubt the idea is super original in its stripped-down form.

There's also a toolbar for choosing the actual image, zoom to fit, zoom to 1:1 scale, and one that toggles a grid (that is visible only if the scale is at least 1:1).

Currently adapting the originally WinForms-based app into wpf for practice, and because wpf seems to have better support for viewing other types of media, which I want to try including.
